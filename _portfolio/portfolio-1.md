title: "Unraveling the photocatalytic potential of transition metal sulfide and selenide monolayers for overall water splitting and photo-corrosion inhibition"
excerpt: "This computational study identifies 2D transition metal sulfides/selenides (MoS₂, WS₂, PtSe₂, PdSe₂, NiSe₂) as breakthrough photocatalysts for efficient overall water splitting. These monolayers achieve record solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies (up to 22.2%) and near-zero hydrogen evolution overpotentials while resisting corrosion in acidic/neutral environments. Their optimal band alignment enables simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen production, offering a scalable green energy solution.
