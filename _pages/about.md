Herein, one can learn the application of computational methods in materials science, focusing on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Youâ€™ll learn to use tools like VASP, LAMMPS, Quantum ESPRESSO, and COMSOL for materials modeling, alongside Python/Linux scripting for data analysis and automation. Practical topics include software installation, simulation setup, and result interpretation. The course prioritizes hands-on experience with real-world examples, and resources will be updated regularly on the Teaching section of the website.
