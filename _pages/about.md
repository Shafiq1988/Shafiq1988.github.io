### Research Intrest
My research employs advanced computational methods—including first-principles calculations, GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW+BSE) techniques, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations—to investigate functional materials for renewable energy applications. I specialize in elucidating the structural, electronic, optical, magnetic, and catalytic properties of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials and inorganic compounds, with the goal of designing high-performance materials for sustainable energy technologies.

### Technical expertise 
I am proficient in leveraging computational tools such as VASP, LAMMPS, Quantum ESPRESSO, Materials Studio, and COMSOL for materials modeling and multiscale simulations. My workflow integrates Python and Linux scripting for data analysis, automation, and custom code development, alongside Mathematica for symbolic computations and algorithm design.

### Teaching experience 
I lecture on computational materials science and solid-state physics, covering topics such as density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics, electronic structure analysis, and material property prediction. Detailed syllabi and course content are available in the Teaching section.
